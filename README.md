## Description
This is a hands-on introduction to programming the computer for creative applications. This course will introduce and explore fundamental coding concepts, such as logic sequencing, data structures, data flow, and event-drive interactions in the context of screen-based projects. Iterative assignments will facilitate the development of a final creative code-driven experience. The open source, JavaScript-based [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) programming framework for creative coding is the primary vehicle for the class using the [web editor for p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/). Both sections assume no programming experience at all. [TBD - Independent studies are available for students who already have experience with programming in JavaScript and p5.js.]()

## Objectives
By the end of this course, we will be able to:
* Understand the fundemental coding concepts, including variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, array, and objects;
* Practically engage these concepts in creative work;
* Develop a working knowledge of JavaScript and the p5.js programming framework. 

## Community Guidelines
Following [NYU's Student Conduct Policies](https://tinyurl.com/scpnyu) and the [IMA Low Res Rules of Play](URL_TBA), we are committed to providing an inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space for everyone in the community. Harassment or discrimination in any form will not be tolerated, and this applies to any interactions and content in all IMA Low Res spaces including but not limited to the Creative Coding Summer 2021 classes.

## Format
The class meetings for the NYU IMA Low Res Summer Session II will be held over teleconference, at the scheduled class times. 

This class will be “flipped”, meaning that you will have to watch the watch and read tutorials before class and do hands-on work in class. You will have assignments to do before both classes.

This course is a workshop and seminar, not a lecture class. It relies heavily on group discussion and participation during class time. If you cannot attend at the class time, please talk to your instructor in advance to figure out an alternative plan. We will do everything we can to accommodate you, but we need to know in advance in order to do so.

## Assignments & Final Project
We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class. These assignments are required and you should be prepared to show and talk about them in class. It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a blog for their assignments.

All assignments should be submitted two hours before the class begins on the day they are due.

The course will culminate with final projects. You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that builds off or is inspired by the concepts we cover during the semester.

## Evaluation
Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:
* Regular Assignments 40%
* Participation and Attendance 40%
* Final Project 20%

Please see ITP's statement on [Pass/Fail](http://help.itp.nyu.edu/academic-policies/pass-fail) which states that a "Pass" is equivalent to an "A" or a "B" while anything less would be considered a "Fail".

This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects. This (along with attendance) is 40% of your grade.

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. Please email your instructor if you are going to miss a class. Two unexcused absences is cause for failing the class. (An unexcused lateness of 10 minutes or more is equivalent to 1/2 an absence.)

## Statements

### Statement of Academic Integrity
Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

### Statement of Principle
The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice.  Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.  For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the [Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook](https://tisch.nyu.edu/student-affairs/important-resources/tisch-policies-and-handbooks).

### Statement on Accessibility
Please feel free to make suggestions to your instructor about ways in which this class could become more accessible to you.  Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212 998-4980 for further information.

### Statement on Counseling and Wellness
Your health and safety are a priority at NYU. If you experience any health or mental health issues during this course, we encourage you to utilize the support services of the 24/7 NYU Wellness Exchange 212-443-9999. Also, all students who may require an academic accommodation due to a qualified disability, physical or mental, please register with the Moses Center 212-998-4980. Please let your instructor know if you need help connecting to these resources.

### Statement on Use of Electronic Devices
Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lecture. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations.  Phone use in class is strictly prohibited unless directly related to a presentation of your own work or if you are asked to do so as part of the curriculum.

### Statement on Title IX
