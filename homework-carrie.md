## Week 00: Drawing in p5.js
————————————————————————————

***To be completed before the 1st class.***
* Watch: [Coding Train videos 1.1-1.6](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA)
* Log in to the [p5 web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).
* Use [2D primitive shapes](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape) to create a “self-portrait” in p5. Add comments to your code to describe the different parts, e.g. eyes, nose, mouth, etc. **Keep it simple!**
* Here are some examples:

* Create a sketch that includes all of these and write about it in a blog post:
  * One element controlled by the mouse.
  * One element that changes over time, independently of the mouse.
  * One element that is different every time you run the sketch.
  * **Submit your sketches [here]().**
