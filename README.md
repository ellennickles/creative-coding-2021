## Description
This is a hands-on introduction to programming the computer for creative applications. This course will introduce computational thinking and explore fundamental coding concepts, such as order of operations, logic sequencing, data structures, data flow, and event-driven interactions in the context of screen-based projects. Iterative assignments will facilitate the development of a final creative code-driven experience. The open source, JavaScript-based [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) programming framework for creative coding is the primary vehicle for the class using the [web editor for p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/). Both sections assume no programming experience at all.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this course, we will be able to:
* describe possibilities of computational thinking and coding for creative applications;
* recognize p5.js as a Javascript framework for drawing graphics and working with media on the HTML Canvas element of a web page;
* identify fundamental coding concepts, such as variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, arrays, and objects;
* identify approaches to debug errors in our code, including how to interpret error messages and printing messages to the Console of the p5.js web editor;
* practice and apply these coding concepts and debugging approaches in our creative work using p5.js.

## Community Guidelines
Following [NYU's Student Conduct Policies](https://tinyurl.com/scpnyu) and the [IMA Low Res Rules of Play](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QH9lqtzUl8qOX9goJIKEmvMUpfPgLjRJpKm-UPPnFHs/edit#heading=h.4qxpmfter73o), we are committed to providing an inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space for everyone in the community. Harassment or discrimination in any form will not be tolerated, and this applies to any interactions and content in all IMA Low Res spaces including but not limited to the Creative Coding Summer 2021 classes.

## Structure and Teaching Methodology
This is a 5-week course that meets twice a week, synchronously in Zoom. We will have assignments to do before each class, and these assignments will build towards a final project that we will present at the end of the semester.

This course embraces an active-learning approach with the belief that programming is best understood by doing. In keeping with this approach, class time will be structured as a workshop and seminar instead of a lecture, relying heavily on group discussion and participation. Weekly video tutorials to watch before class sessions will introduce fundamental coding concepts. During class, supplemental code examples will be presented and discussed before hands-on work together. Time will also be allotted to share our weekly assignments. Examples and assignments will iteratively build upon lessons learned in preceding classes.  

We are encouraged to reach out to the instructors outside of class to ask questions, share ideas/feedback, and discuss topics in detail.


## Assignments and Final Project
### Weekly Assignments 
* Before class, we will watch video tutorials about the fundamental coding concepts that we will practice together when we meet.
* We will also have weekly programming assignments that are relevant to the material from previous classes. Each week will include a series of practice questions and one open-ended exercise to apply the concepts that we practiced in class. The assignments are required, and we should be prepared to show and talk about them in class. 
* We should submit our weekly programming assignments by the following deadlines:
    * For Section 1 with Ellen, submit by 11:59pm ET the day before our class.
    * For Section 2 with Carrie, submit by 11:59am ET the day of our class. 

### Final Project
* The course will culminate with the completion of a final project to be shared in class. 
* We are expected to push our abilities to produce something that builds off or is inspired by the concepts we cover during the semester. 
* We are welcome to combine our final project for this class with a final project from another class.

## Evaluation
This class uses a Pass/Fail grading system. A Pass is equivalent to an A or a B grade, and anything less is considered a Fail.

Grades will be determined according to this criteria:
* Regular Assignments 40%
* Participation and Attendance 40%
* Final Project 20%

This class is participatory. You are expected to contribute to discussions and provide feedback to other students in class, which includes engaging with their assignments and projects. This, along with attendance, is 40% of your grade.

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. Please email your instructor if you are going to miss a class. Two unexcused absences is cause for failing the class. An unexcused lateness of 10 minutes or more is equivalent to 1/2 of an absence.

## Statements

### Statement of Academic Integrity
Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

### Statement of Principle
The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice.  Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.  For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the [Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook](https://tisch.nyu.edu/student-affairs/important-resources/tisch-policies-and-handbooks).

### Statement on Accessibility
Please feel free to make suggestions to your instructor about ways in which this class could become more accessible to you. Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212 998-4980 for further information.

### Statement on Counseling and Wellness
Your health and safety are a priority at NYU. If you experience any health or mental health issues during this course, we encourage you to utilize the support services of the 24/7 NYU Wellness Exchange 212-443-9999. Also, all students who may require an academic accommodation due to a qualified disability, physical or mental, please register with the Moses Center 212-998-4980. Please let your instructor know if you need help connecting to these resources.

### Statement on Use of Electronic Devices
Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lecture. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations.  Phone use in class is strictly prohibited unless directly related to a presentation of your own work or if you are asked to do so as part of the curriculum.

### Statement on Title IX
Tisch School of the Arts to dedicated to providing its students with a learning environment that is rigorous, respectful, supportive and nurturing so that they can engage in the free exchange of ideas and commit themselves fully to the study of their discipline. To that end Tisch is committed to enforcing University policies prohibiting all forms of sexual misconduct as well as discrimination on the basis of sex and gender.  Detailed information regarding these policies and the resources that are available to students through the Title IX office can be found by using the following link: [Title IX at NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/equal-opportunity/title9.html).
