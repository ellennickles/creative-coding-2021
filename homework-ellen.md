## Homework Guidelines
Assignments are **due by 6:00am ET the day of our class** so I have a chance to review your questions before we meet. All assignments are expected to be submitted by the stated deadline. If you anticipate any challenges meeting the deadline, please reach out to me so that we can consider your options together.

A big part of learning in the IMA Low Res program is learning from each other. Share your work and in return you'll see everyone else's!

- **Weekly Worksheet.** There are worksheets (linked below) to practice the concepts introduced in this course. You are expected to add links to your p5.js (p5) sketches directly tp these documents*. 
- <strong>Weekly Exercise and Blog Post.**</strong> Each week there is an open-ended exercise to apply the concepts that we practice. You are expected to add links to your blog posts directly to the weekly exercise documents* (linked below). **Include a link to your p5 sketch in your blog post and answer these questions:**
    - What did you do?
    - What worked?
    - What didn’t work, and what steps did you take to try to solve the issue?
    - Did any code-related questions come up for you?

\*Log in to your NYU account to access the documents.

\**If you are struggling with your weekly exercise sketches, put your energy into writing about what didn't work and how you tried to solve it. It is totally okay to vent your frustrations. Writing a blog post helps to remember and synthesize what you did and tried to do. Think of it as writing a reference guide for your future self.

- CREATE • Make a sketch with a lot of repetition, more than you want to hand-code. Can you make your sketch responsive to mouse behavior or key presses? Some ideas to get started:
    - You might take a previous sketch with a lot of repetition, and re-write it with a loop. For example, instead of needing 30 lines of code to call `rect()`, call `rect()` once inside of a loop that goes around 30 times. Look for a pattern. How do you need to rework the way you position that `rect()` inside the loop?
    - Try creating an algorithmic design with simple parameters. One example is to invent your own [10PRINT](https://10print.org/) design. See [Coding Train Coding Challenge: 10PRINT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEyTZ5ZZxZs&vl=en) and the [example code](https://gist.github.com/shiffman/e683b93f5600dbb7495f). A related source of inspiration: [Sol Lewitt's Wall Drawings](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/).
    - Make a mini-calendar. Use iteration to render a row of visual elements for each of the days of the current month. All of the elements should be drawn identically, except for the one whose index corresponds to the current day. Differentiate this element in some way. Consider using p5's [`day()` function](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/day). (Source: _Code as a Creative Medium_.)
    - Write a blog post that includes a link to your sketch.
    - Submit your post [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VrXGEk_hTCX1jqMX8gBHo_-_1o55DJ6dYFRxxfeCKFk/edit).
- WATCH • [Coding Train Videos 5.1-5.2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) about functions and [Videos 7.1-7.2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) about arrays ~50 min

___

- CREATE • The idea this week is to explore reorganizing / refactoring your code. It is 100% legitimate to turn in a version of a previous assignment where nothing changes for the end user, but the code has been restructured. However, you can also try a new experiment from scratch! For either option, aim to keep `setup()` and `draw()` as clean as possible, and do everything (all calculations, drawing, etc.) in functions that you create yourself. Possibilities (choose two or more):
    - Break the code out of `setup()` and `draw()` into functions.
    - Use a function to draw a design multiple times with different arguments.
    - Reorganize "groups of variables" into object literals.
    - For anything that repeats, use a loop to make it happen.
    - Write a blog post that includes a link to your sketch.
    - Submit your post [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1niO3xN_NNvP1Zlr4AvxxwncpCm2ZkmCsASIn3VGVwW4/edit).
